## Introduction

This repository provides implementations of various machine learning algorithms, from simple linear models to more complex neural networks. Each algorithm is implemented in Python, with a focus on clarity and simplicity. The goal is to help data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and developers understand the underlying concepts and apply these models in real-world scenarios.

## Algorithms Implemented

The repository includes the following algorithms:

### Supervised Learning

- **Linear Regression**: A basic algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable.
- **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm used for binary outcomes.
- **Decision Trees**: A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane for separating different classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Gradient Boosting**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to reduce errors.
- **Neural Networks**: A series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data.

### Unsupervised Learning

- **K-Means Clustering**: A method for partitioning a dataset into distinct clusters.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method of cluster analysis that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality-reduction technique used to reduce the complexity of datasets.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings.

### Reinforcement Learning

- **Q-Learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state.

### Dimensionality Reduction

- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: A tool to visualize high-dimensional data by reducing it to 2 or 3 dimensions.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Each algorithm has its own folder, containing a Python script that demonstrates the algorithm with sample data. To run an algorithm, navigate to the corresponding folder and run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
cd <algorithm_folder>
python <algorithm_script.py>
